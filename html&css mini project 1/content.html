                        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing
                         how content contained within an HTML file is structured.
                         This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images
                          and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.

                        <p>CSS is the ronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language
                             for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). 
                             This language contains coding elements and is composed of these 
                             “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files (. css).

                                <p>  Bootstrap is a CSS framework and toolkit. Developers can't use it to write
                                    programs, but because Bootstrap contains massive amounts of reusable
                                    code and website element templates, the framework can remove some of the “busy work”
                                     and significantly speed up the process of building a website
